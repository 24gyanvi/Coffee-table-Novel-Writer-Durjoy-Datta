<br>
<font face="brush script MT" size=8>On a lazy Sunday morning, two young people are wheeled into Room No. 509 of GKL
 super specialty hospital.<br>

A brilliant nineteen year old medical student, suffering from an incurable, fatal disease hurtling her at a slow, 
painful, uncertain death.
<br>
A wasteful twenty five year old drug addict, with no appreciation of life, with every organ system of his body slowly
 shutting down.<br>

Two prodigious doctors, fighting their own demons from the past, try to keep these two patients alive, putting their
 medical licenses at risk.<br>

Death looms in the tiny 12X13 foot room as they fight for every breath of their lives, even as the doctors 
put them through unapproved experimental treatments to prolong their lives.<br>

How will the last month of pain and struggle change their lives? How will it transform the doctors who work 
steadfastly to make them live a little longer?<br>
